||| Description of a language's grammar. The `tok` parameter is the type
||| of tokens, and the `consumes` flag is True if the language is guaranteed
||| to be non-empty - that is, successfully parsing the language is guaranteed
||| to consume some input.

||| Sequence two grammars. If either consumes some input, the sequence is

-- parameters:
-- compile time:
--   c: are we parsing a consuming grammar?
-- run time:
--   commit: have we already committed? What does 'already?' mean here?
--           or perhaps it means something about what we want the
--             commit behaviour of the returned results to be?
--      do we ever need this? do we ever make commit results that don't
--        come entirely from the results of running subsidiary parsers?
--        (which is either alternative or sequencing)
--      lets just ignore the com parameter and think about if thats ok?
--      so then I'll remove it...
--      all end parsers don't commit except Commit.
--      basic combinators have more complicated behaviour: if either of
--         the parameters commits, then the combined parser commits.
--   xs: tokens remaining to parse
--   act: grammar to be used to parse remaining tokens
-- Returns: success or failure, along with whether 'act' committed, in which
--          case no alternatives should be tried.

-- commitment test case:
--    c <- char 'a' <|> char 'b'
--    stuff
--    char c -- matches whichever of a, b we met before
--  should that check a ... a, and if the final a fails, backtrack and try b ... b?
--  it's not clear to me. is the <|> at the top in some sense committing in that it
--  will ignore later failure? despite there being no specific Boolean True commit
--  flag set.
--  in one sense, yes, because it should behave like a list-style backtracker.
--  in another sense, we should only try the alternative if the first parser fails,
--    not if the failure happens later in the parse.
